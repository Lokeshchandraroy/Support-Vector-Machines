# Using an SVM algorithm, scientists can analyze data on iris flower measurements (sepal and petal dimensions) to predict the flower's species (Setosa, Versicolor, or Virginica). 
# The algorithm finds a dividing line that best separates the different flower types based on their measurements. This allows them to classify new, unknown flowers based on their measurements.
